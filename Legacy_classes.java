/*Legacy Classes
Early versions of java.util did not include the Collections Framework. Instead, it
defined several classes and an interface that provided an ad hoc method of storing objects.
When collections were added (by J2SE 1.2), several of the original classes were reengineered
to support the collection interfaces. Thus, they are fully compatible with the framework.
The legacy classes defined by java.util are shown here:
Dictionary Hashtable Properties Stack Vector
Vector implements a dynamic array. It is similar to ArrayList, but with two differences:
Vector is synchronized, and it contains many legacy methods that are not part of the
Collections
Vector is declared like this:
class Vector<E>
Here, E specifies the type of element that will be stored.
Here are the Vector constructors:
Vector( )
Vector(intsize)
Vector(int size, int incr)
Hashtable was part of the original java.util and is a concrete implementation of a ictionary.
However, with the advent of collections, Hashtable was reengineered to also implement the
Map interface. Thus, Hashtable is now integrated into the Collections Framework. It is so
Similar to HashMap, but is synchronized.
Like HashMap, Hashtable stores key/value pairs in a hash table. However, neither keys nor
values can be null. When using a Hashtable, you specify an object that is used as a key, and
the value that you want linked to that key. The key is then hashed, and the resulting hash code
is used as the index at which the value is stored within the table.
Hashtable was made generic by JDK 5. It is declared like this:
class Hashtable<K, V>*/
